<span style="font-weight: bold;">SVN revision r813 contains
major changes to FindCUDA.cmake. Please see details below. To use the
old script, check out a prior revision from the svn server.<br>
<br>
NOTE: The source code is hosted at a new svn server: </span><a
 href="https://gforge.sci.utah.edu/gf/project/findcuda/scmsvn/?action=browse&path=%2Ftrunk%2F">https://gforge.sci.utah.edu/svn/findcuda/trunk</a><span

This web page contains information about an unofficial version
of the
FindCuda.cmake script I developed for my own CUDA programs.<span
 style="font-style: italic;"></span> Many individuals have adopted the
script and suggested improvements, and tested the script on various
platforms and configurations. I appreciate all of the feedback and bug
fixes I have received since the initial release.<br>
<p>This webpage is updated infrequently- the svn log contains details
about bug fixes and updates.</p>
<p>Please send any comments or questions to my email. If you use the
NVIDIA forums, I might not see you question for some time.</p>

Features:<br>
<ul>
  <li>Works on all CUDA platforms, tested with CUDA 2.1 beta. Will
generate visual studio project files.<br>
  </li>
  <li>Parses an nvcc generated dependency file into CMake format.
Targets will be regenerated when dependencies change.</li>
  <li>Displays kernel register usage during compilation.</li>
  <li>Support for compilation to executable, shared libary, or PTX.<br>
  </li>
</ul>
<h2>Source Code:</h2>
We released a major revision to the script in December 2008 at
approximately the same time as the CUDA 2.1 beta. There are many
differences in the new version of the script and it has been tested
extensively on Linux, Mac, and WinXP/Vista. <br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">It is necessary to make several
changes to a project's CMakeLists.txt files in order to use the new
version.</span><br>
<br>
List of partial changes:<br>
<ul>
  <li>The capitalization of the script's filename is changed to
FindCUDA.cmake.</li>
  <li>The script may be included using FIND_PACKAGE (see example code).<br>
  </li>
  <li>Switched to standard CMake package variable names: (e.g. <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">CUDA_INCLUDE_DIRS</span> instead of
CUDA_INCLUDE,<span style="font-weight: bold;"> CUDA_LIBRARIES</span>
instead of CUDA_TARGET_LINK).</li>
  <li>Selection of Device or Release mode via boolean option <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">CUDA_BUILD_EMULATION</span> instead
of a text string.</li>
  <li>Paths added to INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES are passed to nvcc.</li>
  <li>Added option to host compilation mode boolean option.</li>
  <li>Added CUDA_COMPILE_PTX macro for compilation to .ptx.</li>
  <li>Added a macro generated target to clean all generated
dependencies.</li>
  <li>Locates the cuFFT and cuBLAS libraries as well (both in Device
and Emulation mode).<br>
  </li>
</ul>
Major bug fixes:<br>
<ul>
  <li>Fixed problem in Emulation mode which caused targets to
continuously be rebuilt.</li>
  <li>Fixed problems associated with incomplete compilation in visual
studio.</li>
  <li>Updated default paths for toolkit and SDK on several platforms.<br>
  </li>
</ul>
<br>
Notes:<br>
<ul>
  <li>Set the cmake cache variable <span style="font-weight: bold;">CUDA_BUILD_CUBIN</span>
to enable or disable generation and parsing of .cubin files for kernels
in Device mode. When enabled the number of registers, memory usage,
etc. will be printed to the console for each kernel. This information
can be entered in the <a
 href="http://developer.nvidia.com/object/cuda.html#downloads">Cuda
occupancy calculator</a>. </li>
  <li>The script will output the actual command lines used in verbose
mode (e.g. make VERBOSE=1).<br>
  </li>
  <li>The example code is intended to demonstrate cmake script usage
only, the .cu files don't do anything illustrative.</li>
</ul>
<br>
The code is available in an svn repository:
https://gforge.sci.utah.edu/svn/CMake-cuda<br>
<br>
Either checkout the example project:<br>
<br>
<table border="1" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="2" width="100%">
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>
      <pre><br>svn co https://gforge.sci.utah.edu/svn/findcuda/trunk CMake-cuda</pre>
      </td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>
<br>
<br>
<h2>Usage:</h2>
The script will search for your cuda toolkit and SDK installation using
several standard paths and the
environment variables which are created by the installer. <br>
<br>
The following example includes the script and shows how to add code in
an executable. The CUDA_ADD_* commands have the same
semantics as the standard ADD_* commands.<br>
<br>
<table style="text-align: left; width: 546px; height: 117px;" border="1"
 cellpadding="2" cellspacing="2">
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td style="vertical-align: top;"><span
